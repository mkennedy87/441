I slowly went through the example code and did some copy and pasting. After I got things running properly I went and got my own images. I wanted to fill the game with only 2 of each image so I grabbed 6 images for the faces and 1 for the backs of the cards. When I brought my own photos in I went and edited the code until I figured out how to get all images to only display twice. I mostly just copy and pasted the css as I didn't want to spend time figuring it out.
