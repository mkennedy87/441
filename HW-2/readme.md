After doing the reading from the class website I went through the assignment. I got a little hung up on actually linking the script.js page as I kept trying to write "./" in front of the link. I also had to take some time to figure out why it was not printing and it was because hit return several times in my original string.

When I used chat gpt to write my code it worked really well. I did each page individually and it gave me exactly what I asked for. All I would have had to do to get the code to work would have been to create the file, and then copy and paste the code. I think I would need to get to the point of knowing what the code meant before actually using it. I think that the work still belongs to me as I see AI as a tool I used to make the code. As long as it's learning was sourced ethically.
