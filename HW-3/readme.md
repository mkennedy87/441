So, the plan was to make a choose your own adventure starting with rival animation studios, then you'd pick a place, and then you'd pick a character. I've spent an entire day on this assignment and I couldn't quite get it figured out. I started making all the functions I thought I needed, and even got it to increment, but I couldn't get it to change the photos.

I just found out that there's an example for the assignment...

Ok, so unfortunately I have to borrow a lot of code from the example just to make sure I could turn this in on time. It turns out the code is a lot simpler than I was trying to make it. I left all the code that I was originally trying to make work in the file, I just commented it out in the html and made a brand new js file.
