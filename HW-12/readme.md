I went through the class website, and next I started going through the code in the example homework. Next I started setting up my folders and files that I think I'm going to need. Started copying code from the example. The link I used for Jquery apparently didn't work, so I bypassed this by just adding the library. I've got the code almost working, I just can't figure out how to get the object to be collected.
