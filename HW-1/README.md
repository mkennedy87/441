Homework for week 1

I am lost, but am slowly figuring things out. I shouldn't have put this week's activities off for as long as I did.

I am currently going through the web dev website I have saved in my bookmarks as fast as possible.

I started building up confidence towards the end and have gotten to refamiliarise myself with some of HTML 5.
