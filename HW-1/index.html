            Hi, I’m Mike Kennedy. I like to draw comics and animate. I am from Great Falls, MT and am a non-traditional student. I am currently a senior at UM. I like to play games online to keep in touch with friends and family, usually this is Overwatch. Looney Tunes is a huge inspiration for my desire to draw cartoons.

            Apparently, I took my last web design class over 5 years ago and I’m currently feeling pretty lost. I look forward to getting caught back up and hope to learn skills that keep me coding.
