So for my final, I wanted to make a small game using phaser.io. I used the code from week 13's assignment and started editing the code from there. I expanded the canvas and created my own asset for the background and platforms. I then moved the platforms around so that the palyer had to use them to jump a gap in the level. I wanted to create all the assets myself including the sprite for the character but in intrest of saving time I opted out of that. I created a spike pit that is an instant game over and collecting the single star ends the game with a win. I needed to remove the ceiling so the player could actually jump across, so I removed the canvas collision and added physical walls to the level. I had the game add text to let the player know when they win or lose. That last thing I tried to do was change the scale on the star but I couldn't figure that out.
